##### 20 Years of Serving

Every meal comes backed with 20 years of cooking and catering experience. Myself and my wife have been regularly catering 1-3 events a week, and we always aim to please.

Notably, we've been faithfully volunteering at our local church to not only serve The Lord with our time and skills in the kitchen, but to keep ministries growing by keeping our church goers coming back every week for ribs, burritos, grilled chicken, brisket, and more!
